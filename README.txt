For your bot to work properly you must fill two boxes in the line of code!

the first one, you have to put the TOKEN of your bot discord between '' here:
    bot.login ( '');

the token can be found on the website: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/

the second you have to fill this line with your ID (between ''):
    if (message.author.id! == '')


Then you must install the NPM that are present on the bot, doing in your TERMINAL:

npm install -d


To launch your bot use the start.bat

do '$dmall your message' in chat

And here is your bot is finally ready for DMALL.
Enjoy !! :P
